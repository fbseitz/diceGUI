# diceGUI
Dice roll simulator, using an executable GUI

This is the initial version of a diceroll simulator which I used to learn how to use the Tkinter library for GUI applications, as well as to learn basics of using Pyinstaller to create standalone executables. The application currently exists as a one folder program containing an executable, uploaded here as GUIproject.zip. The relevant code is uploaded as GUIproject.py and guiprojectfunctions.py., with a necessary image of 'dice_image.png' used in the GUI. There is also an image (slightly off center) of what it looks like when running as GUIprojectimage.png.

The current plan is to revise future versions of this to add an updating graph of roll results, and possibly make this a one file (rather than folder) executable. I'll also use that as an opportunity to learn Git/version control.

***9/9/21 Update***

The updated version of this project incorportating the dice roll history as a graph in the GUI is now live. This has not been redone as a standalone executable, but should work in a code editor.
